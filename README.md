# -Traffic-Light-Control-System-Using-ATmega328P
This project simulates a simple traffic light system using an ATmega328P microcontroller. It cycles through red, yellow, and green lights, with each light staying on for 3 seconds. A manual switch allows users to disable the system during maintenance.
